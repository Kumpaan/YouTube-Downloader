# YouTube-Downloader
For functioning you need to have FFmpeg downloaded and then in the Downloader select path of the folder in which is ffmpeg.exe located. In default the path is set to C:\ffmpeg\bin so that is the best case you can set.
Install the ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases , unzip the content and in the Downloader set the path to bin folder.
